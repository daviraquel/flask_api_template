# Flask API template

Welcome!

This is a template for building RESTful API's in Python Flask and PostgreSQL using MVC architecture.

It has a user CRUD (Create, Read, Upgrade, Delete) and login using JWT authentication. Most files have comments explaining what's done and directions to create similar file and tables.

Feel free to use it, give feedback and get in touch if you have any questions!
